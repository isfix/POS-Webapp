## Style Guidelines:

- Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA), chosen to evoke a sense of calm and sophistication, like a quiet morning in a well-run cafe.
- Light Gray (#F0F0F0), offering a neutral backdrop that complements the primary color and enhances readability.
- Muted Grape (#8484A0), used for interactive elements, providing subtle contrast and visual interest while aligning with the overall theme.
- 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a modern, objective feel, ensuring clarity and ease of reading across the application.
- Minimalist icons, designed to integrate seamlessly within the blurred glass effect, with a focus on clarity and ease of recognition.
- The layout emphasizes a clean, modern aesthetic, mirroring iOS design principles with a focus on content hierarchy and ease of navigation.
- Subtle liquid-like transitions and animations that enhance user experience, without being distracting.
- "Glassmorphism" - A layered interface with a frosted-glass effect on background elements.
- Backgrounds of modals, sidebars, and cards will have a background-blur effect, allowing the content behind to be subtly visible.
- Text and icons on blurred surfaces will have a slight "glow" or increased saturation to maintain readability, mimicking iOS's vibrancy effect.
- Clean, spacious, with a strong grid system. Heavy use of whitespace.
- A collapsible side menu. In full view, it shows icons and text labels. When collapsed (via a user toggle), the text disappears, leaving only the larger, clear icons, maximizing screen real estate.
- Inter or a similar modern sans-serif font. Use clear hierarchical sizing for headers, sub-headers, and body text.
- Subtle, fluid transitions. Modals should scale and fade in, lists should have a gentle stagger effect when loading. All animations should be performance-optimized (transform, opacity).
