# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.
This project provides a comprehensive platform for managing cafe operations, including AI-powered tools, financial tracking, inventory management, and reporting.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

The `/src/app/(app)/data/page.tsx` file is a key component of this application, responsible for managing menu items. It utilizes the `handleEditItem` function to enable users to edit existing menu items. This function interacts with Firestore to update the item details and also logs the activity for auditing purposes.

Styling guidelines for the project can be found in `/docs/blueprint.md`.
